A lightweight script that makes firearms behave with strong random recoil.

Thinking of a creative way to make the players not to use fire weapons at the start of the server this idea came up.

The weapon still fires normally, but each shot slightly distorts the player’s aim at the moment of firing, causing bullets to go in a random direction instead of exactly where the crosshair is pointed.

On every shot:

A small smoke effect appears near the weapon muzzle.

The player experiences a heavy recoil effect (camera shake + chance to stumble or briefly fall).

The purpose is to add a realistic or chaotic/comedic gun behavior without fully disabling weapon usage.
